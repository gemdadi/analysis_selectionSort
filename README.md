# analysis_selectionSort
A Big-Θ analysis  
Benchmarking the behavior of Java implementations of selection sort  
The program include both an iterative and recursive version of the algorithm  
result by run SortMain class in Eclipse:

 Project.docx involves an analysis of the results :  
-Graphs of  results  
-A comparison of the performance of the two versions of the algorithm(iterative and recursive)  
-A comparison of the critical operation results and the actual execution time measurements  
-A discussion of the significance of the standard deviation results and how it reflects the data sensitivity of your algorithm o how your results compare to your Big-Θ analysis
